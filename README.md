# Artificial Intelligence

This is a course of Artificial Intelligence of the Uppsala University during Fall 2021.  
Through this course, I learned to recognise that a problem is an AI-problem, to create a model for those AI-problems and point out an appropriate solution (for example expert systems, search algorithms, learning, statistical methods).  
Moreover, I have learned to discuss different definitions of AI, and relate those to the history of AI.

Key words: Heuristic search, knowledge representation, expert systems, learning systems. Applications of AI, for instance in computer games.
